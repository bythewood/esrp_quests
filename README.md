### ESRP_Quests
## Prelude
ESRP_Quests and ESRP_Dialog were originally created by **OfficiallyM**.

Both tools originated in the [RedEM:RP](https://github.com/RedEM-RP) landscape as [RedEMRP_Quests](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redemrp_quests) and [RedEMRP_Dialog](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redemrp_dialog) respectively before being converted to support [VORP](https://github.com/VORPCORE/VORP-Core).  

[RedEM:RP](https://github.com/RedEM-RP) was created and maintained by [amakuu](https://github.com/amakuu/) and [Kto≈õ](https://github.com/Ktos93/).

[ESRP_Quests](https://github.com/bythewood/esrp_quests) and [ESRP_Dialog](https://github.com/bythewood/esrp_dialog) are now being maintained and updated by a certain medical crab.
